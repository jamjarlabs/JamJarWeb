# Texture

This example shows how textures are loaded and displayed using sprites.

## Overview

This example loads an image (`assets/example.png`) in 6 different ways, using different options for wrapping and
filtering. Each differently loaded texture is rendered with a sprite.

## Running

> This example uses a relative dependency link to the JamJar engine to make sure it uses the latest code, if copying
> this code be sure to run `yarn add jamjar` to tie down to a specific version.

Run `yarn` to download the required dependencies.

* `yarn start` - Run the example using webpack-dev-server.
* `yarn build` - Build the example into the `dist/` folder.
